1) String pool
-> String pool is seprate structure for create inside to the heap memory

ex = String a = "name"
     String b = "name" 
    
    a --> name <--name

-> Here a and b is point to the sampe name object in heap memory 
-> it means the both are the refrence variable

2) String Immutabal
-> but if the any varible value can change other refrence variable can't be change
becuase string is Immutabal 

ex String a = "name"  
    a = "age" // here new object create not change the name value
   String b = "name


3) comparison of String (==)

-> string pool are provide the same value of the different refrence varible
String p1 = "preet"
String p2 = "preet"

p1==p2 return true  
p1 --> preet  <-- p2  here both refrence variable point to same object

but if
p1 --> preet
p2 -->preet
p1==p2 return false
p1 and p2 are point to different value return false
