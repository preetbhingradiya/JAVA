*** CONSTRUCTORS ***
constructors is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object
creation
@* Type of constructors
 1) Non-parameterized
 2) Parameterized
 3) Copy

*** ENCAPTULATION ***
Encaptulation is defined as the wrapping up of data and methods unser a single unit.
it also implements of data binding

*** INHERITANCE ***
inheritance is when propertiy and methods of base class are passed on to a derived class
inheritance means one class propertiy and methods are pass to another class

@* Type of inheritance
    1)Single inheritance
    -> only one based(parent) class and deried(child) class to pass propertiy and methods

    2)Multi inheritance
    ->top to bottom all ony by one class property and metods are pass(inheritance)
            base class -> deried class -> derived class(this child class of previous class)

    3)Hierarchical inheritance
    ->only one based(parent) class and Multipal deried(child) class to pass(inheritance) propertiy and methods
                                       based
                    deried(child)                   deried(child)

     4)Hybrid inheritance

*** POLYMORPHISM  ***
 -> Multipal froms(structur) apply same work that use polymorphism
 ->when you try the achive same thing and try do a similler thing in multipal froms

 1)Compile time polymorphism (static)
 -> Method Overloading
 => multipal methods with same name but different parameters    

 2)Run time polymorphism (daynamic)
 -> Methods Overriding
 =>parent and child class both contain same methods name with the different defination


* PACKAGE is group of similler type of classes , interfaces and sub-packages;
